## Topics Covered:
- MLflow components (tracking, registry, models)
- Experiment tracking
- Model logging
- MLflow UI

## Hands-On:
- Cleaned the product performance data to remove errors and inconsistencies.
- Transformed the records into a finalized format for modeling.
- Stored the high-quality data in a permanent table.
- Loaded the refined data into the Machine Learning environment.
- Split the data into training (80%) and testing(20%) sets for evaluation.
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict product sales.
- Evaluated the model performance using the R-squared metric.
- Achieved an accuracy score of 93% for purchase predictions.
- Captured the training results and accuracy metrics in MLflow.
- Prepared the final model for future use.
